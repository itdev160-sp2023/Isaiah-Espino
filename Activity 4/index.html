    <p>The 2020 PRS SE Hollowbody ii is a true master piece. It is light weight and versitile. 
       The humbucker pick ups provide a clean and light tone, but also carry a beautiful distortion.
        I give the guitar a 9.5 on a scale of 10. For the price point of the guitar there is not much left to be desired.

    <p>The 2023 PRS SE McCarty 594. Is a guitar that is built for those who know what hey are doing. 
       The humbucker pick ups provide a clean and light tone, with 2 potted push/pull knobs a five switch selector and two volumn control knobs,
       The 594 will not only get the job done, but exceed expectations.
       I give the guitar a 9 on a scale of 10. The Price Point is high for an SE, 
       but the product you are getting is as close to a core as you will get from the SE line.

                <h3>Conclution</h3>
                <p>The PRS SE line is an excellent line of guitars that are affordable,
                    but look, play and feel like a high end guitar. I have owned many guitars
                    but the PRS SE line is unrivaled by any other brand in its class.
                    I would recommend giving them a try and falling in love.
